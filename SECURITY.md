How to Report a Potential Vulnerability?
========================================

Confirmed or potential security vulnerabilities in the meta-riscv layer should
be submitted directly via the
[Issues](https://github.com/riscv/meta-riscv/issues) page.

If you are dealing with a not-yet released or urgent issue, please send a
message to one of the maintainers listed in the [README](README.md). Include as
many details as possible:
  - the layer or software module affected
  - the recipe and its version
  - any example code, if available
